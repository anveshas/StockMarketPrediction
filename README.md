## StockMarketPrediction
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. It involves fetching historical stock data, preprocessing it, training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, making predictions, and visualizing the results.

# Project Overview
The project can be divided into the following main steps:

1. Data Collection: Fetch historical stock price data from a data source (e.g., Yahoo Finance).

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including scaling for input to the model.

3. Model Training: Build and train an LSTM model using historical stock data.

4. Prediction: Make predictions using the trained model on unseen data.

5. Visualization: Visualize the predicted stock prices against actual prices to evaluate the model's performance.
